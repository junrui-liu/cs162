## Struture
- 6 programming assignments, 50%
  - 5 required assignments, each one building on the previous one.
  - Since they are cumulative, I and the TA will do our absolute best to help you get 100% on all of them, if you're willing to put in the work. 
  - The 6th assignment is optional and replaces the one with the lowest score.
  - 5 tokens of "late days". you can use them all on one assignment or spread them out
  - after all 5 tokens used, no more late work accepted
  - LLM policy: TBD
    - Option 1: No LLMs whatsoever
    - Option 2:
      - No LLMs for the first 3 assignments. If you have questions, ask me, the TA, or your classmates. LLMs are known to hallucinate BS, which is antithetic to the goals of this course and especially problematic when you're trying to learn something *for the first time*. We want to teach you to think about programming very carefully, and write correct code!
      - LLMs allowed for the last 3 assignments (once you get a hang of things and can discern BS when you see one), but you should clearly document exactly what you used them for:
        - In file X, I used LLM to generate this line of code on line Y.
        - I asked LLM to explain code X or concept Y to me.
        - This also helps me gauge which concepts are still confusing to students.
- 3 quizzes, 45%
  - held in class, no makeups
  - closed book, closed notes, closed laptops, 15-30 minutes
  - *turn in corrections for 50% credit back at the end of the quarter*
- "perspectives", 5%
  - each week, I will share one or two Youtube videos on some aspect of programming languages -- either directly related to what we talked about that week, or some broader topic that might be interesting/important but unfortunately doesn't fit into the short time we have in class
  - Out of 6 weeks, you pick 3 weeks. For each week, write a short (2-3 paragraphs) reflection on what you learned from the video, what surprised you, what you agreed/disagreed with, how does it change the way you think about programming languages, etc. Share it with the class.
  - Completion = full credit. No need to be a great writer. Just share your thoughts in a way that we can understand, be honest and be thoughtful.
  - LLM policy:
    - Do not use LLMs for these reflections. Think for yourself.

## Pedagoy
- **Growth mindset**: ok to fail, but learn from it (that's why you'll get credit back if you turn in corrections). If you put in the work, you will get the grade you want.
- **Community, not competition** -> no curve to force a certain distribution of grades. Help each other out. Form study groups, come to office hours, ask lots of questions.
- Emphasize that **office hours are for everyone**, not just the struggling students. 
  - Extra credit or other incentives for attending office hours?
  - Feel free to come by and just chat about anything related to the course. There are absolutely no stupid questions. From my experience as a TA, I learn something new from every question asked and every student I talk to. Questions reveal not just gaps in understanding, but also gaps in my communication of the material, e.g., I was going too fast, or I was explaining something in a way that didn't make sense to the student.

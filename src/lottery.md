# Snack Lottery ðŸŽ°


As promised in our first lecture, any unused tokens you still have now go into a lottery to win yummy snacks from [Sakuraco's July snackbox](https://sakura.co/past-boxes/july-2025), which was freshly delivered to me from Japan a few days ago!


> I do not condone gambling in real life; this is just a fun way to distribute snacks to reward your hard work in this course. I'm also not sponsored by Sakuraco, but I do love their snacks and I think you will too!


## Instructions

1. Check how many tokens you still have by going to Canvas/Gradescope. The total number of pts you have for the "Tokens ðŸ’–" assignment is the number of tokens you have (I already subtracted those for quiz corrections).

2. Go to "What's Inside This Box" section of Sakuraco's July snackbox. Then click on any item. This will open a pamphlet containing the description for each of the 14 snacks/items. You should see something like this:

3. Read through the pamphlet, and pick the items you want. There will be 1 lottery round for each item, so you can pick as many items as you'd like to roll for. Please pay careful attention to **Common Allergies** and **May Contain Traces Of** to make sure the snack is safe to consume for you.

4. For each item you want, decide how many tokens you'd like to wager in the item's lottery. The more tokens you wager, the higher the chance you'll win that item. You can bid for any number of items, but you can only wager up to the total number of tokens that you currently have. 

    For example, say I have 10 tokens, and I want Mt.Fuji Biscuit > Dorayaki > Kakimochi in that order, then I can wager 5 tokens for Mt.Fuji Biscuit, 3 tokens for Dorayaki and 2 tokens for Kakimochi.

5. DM me on discord with the items you want and how many tokens you wager for each one.

6. I will livestream the lottery on discord later this week. I'll try hosting the lottery in [Marbles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1170970/Marbles_on_Stream/), as shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUyOgEa6Mxk). Feel free to tune in if you're available. I'll announce the date & the time soon.

7. After the lottery, you can come to my lab in HFH to collect your prizes. I'll reach out to you to schedule an appointment if you won something.

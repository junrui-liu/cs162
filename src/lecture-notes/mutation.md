# Mutants ðŸ§¬



Intro to effects

## Simple effects
- printing
- user input

## Mutable state

- Semantics
- Typing
  - Store typing?
- Garbage collection
- Manual freeing breaks memory safety
- Common misconceptions: mutable variables, pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference
- Question: "local variables" are mutable in C++. Why don't you need to manually free them?
- (maybe) ownership types, substructrual type systems, and Rust

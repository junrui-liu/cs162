# Python üêç

- Quick intro to algebraic data types
  - T is either X or Y
  - T has both X and Y
  - Lots of examples:
    - TBD
- Encoding of ADTs in Python
  - Sum types T = X | Y becomes abstract class T, and subclasses X and Y
  - Product types T = X * Y becomes class T with fields x and y
- Make vs use
  - Product types: make = constructor with all fields, use = field accessors
  - Sum types: make = calling constructor, use = pattern matching
  - Lots of examples:
    - TBD
- Crash course on syntaxes:
  - Concrete vs abstract syntax, role of the parser
  - ASTs
  - How to represent and manipulate ASTs in Python
  - Exercises:
    - TBD

# Types ðŸ”’

- The need to predict program behaviors ahead of time
- Halting problem and Rice's theorem
  - Go through the proof in Python
  - Show that with nats and procedures, our language is already Turing complete and hence cursed by the halting problem
- Tradeoff between
  - Accuracy
  - Automation
- Type system as abstract big-step operational semantics
- Type system as abstract transition system over small-step operational semantics
- Discuss properties of type system:
  - soundness vs completeness
- (?) Prove type soundness via progress and preservation

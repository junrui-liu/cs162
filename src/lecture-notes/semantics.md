# Semantics ðŸ§ 

- Big step operational semantics
  - Nat
    - Add subtraction
    - (exercise) Add multiplication
    - Add booleans: true, false, if-then-else
  -  Add && (syntactic sugar)
     - (exercise) Add || and not
     - (exercise) Add less-than
     - (exercise) Add equality (either as a primitive or as a syntactic sugar)
     - (exercise) Add non-determinism via coin flips
- Small step operational semantics
  - Motivation: observing intermediate steps, especially for non-terminating programs
    - Example: signalgate
    - Example: stepping a program line-by-line in a debugger
  - Motivate the need for two kinds of rules: contextual and evaluation
  - Discuss transitivity
  - Show rules for addition (and similarly for subtraction and multiplication)
  - (exercise) Design rules for less-than
  - (exercise) Design rules for if-then-else

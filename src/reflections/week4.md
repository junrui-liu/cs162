# Feminism in PL

You might be wondering: "what does programming language design have to do with feminism?"

But trust me, the following video and the [accompanying paper](https://www.felienne.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feminism_in_Programming_Language_Design_CR_5-1.pdf) [1] provide a really accessible overview of the kinds of structural problems that affect the PL design and research community today. Surprisingly (or not surprisingly), I also suffer due to some of those problems even as a male phd student working in the field.

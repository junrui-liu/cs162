# Reflections


Here, I will share a couple of Youtube videos each week on some aspect of programming languages -- either directly related to what we talked about that week, or some broader topic that might be interesting/important but unfortunately doesn't fit into the short time we have in class.

Out of 6 weeks, you pick 2 weeks to watch the videos and write a short (2-3 paragraphs) reflection on what you learned from the video, what surprised you, what you agreed/disagreed with, how does it change the way you think about programming languages, how does it relate to your own experience, etc.

Completion = full credit. No need to be a great writer. Just share your thoughts in a way that others can understand, be honest and be thoughtful. You're encouraged to share your reflections with the class and comment on other students' reflections, if you feel comfortable doing so.

Again, don't use LLMs. If you do, it'll defeat the purpose of reflections; I and other students will also waste time reading and commenting on some random string of emotionless symbols that doesn't come from you. If you're tempted to use LLMs, that likely means the week's topic doesn't interest you. In that case, you can skip it and do it in another week when the topic does genuinely interest you, since you only need to choose 2 weeks out of 6 anyway.
